<p class="intro">
Docet is an online documentation manager for JavaEE Web applications aiming at devising truly integrated online-help guides. 
</p>

<h2>Web friendly</h2>

Documentation is written using an HTML-like language, so it is really simple to start writing documentation, you can use your existing tools.
Docet will generate automatically a PDF version of your content without any special additional tool.

<h2>Security</h2>

Docet is not a static file generator, but every access to documentation is handled on the server side: this way you can apply fine grained permissions to each content.
Every page will be generated on the fly for the user and thus it can be personalized

<h2>Integration</h2>

Docet can be easily integrated in your existing JavaEE web application. Your documentation will be compiled and pre-indexed at build time using a simple Maven Plugin and then served by your web application using the SDK.
